## Subnet Addressing

One of the earliest difficulties encountered when the Internet began to grow was the inconvenience of having to allocate a new network number for any new net- work segment that was to be attached to the Internet. This became especially cumbersome with the development and increasing use of local area networks (LANs) in the early 1980s. To address the problem, it was natural to consider a way that a site attached to the Internet could be allocated a network number cen- trally that could then be subdivided locally by site administrators. If this could be accomplished without altering the rest of the Internetâ€™s core routing infrastruc- ture, so much the better.
